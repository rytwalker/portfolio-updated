Daily Pages is a simple note taking app that serves as a great place to jot down ideas and save them for later. It is a full stack app built with full CRUD capability.

Daily pages was built with React and Redux on the front end and Node/Express on the back end. Data is persisted using Heroku and Postgres.

- Built out the front end in 5 days and was able to add many extra features like CSV download, search functionality, and markdown support.
- Back end fully tested using Jest.
