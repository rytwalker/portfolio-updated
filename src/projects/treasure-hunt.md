This project was part of a week-long MUD challenge at Lambda School. This app used different graph traversal algorithms in order to navigate the map.

This little app gives teams the ability to see the overall leaders in pub quiz history. It also gives stats for individual teams. It uses React on the front-end and a Django REST-API on the back-end.
