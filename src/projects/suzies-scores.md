Suzie’s Scores is a desktop app that aggregates trivia scores providing teams with long-term statistics of their performance over time. For over the last year and a half, I have been a quizmaster for a weekly local pub quiz. After realizing that teams who come week after week don't have any way to keep track of their overall progress, I decided to build this app to give teams incentive to keep coming back.
 
The frontend was built with React/Redux while the API was built with Django and Python using Django Rest Framework.

- Built as a side project to bring value to people I interact with on a weekly basis.
- Tracks over 150 team scores over 20 “quizzes” calculating fields like Average Weekly Score and Percentage of Questions Correct.
